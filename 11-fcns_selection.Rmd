## `select_nodes()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_nodes.svg">

<h4><em>Select nodes in a graph</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select nodes from a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

**`conditions`** an option to use filtering conditions for the retrieval of nodes.

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

**`nodes`** an optional vector of node IDs for filtering the list of nodes present in the graph.

## `select_edges()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_edges.svg">

<h4><em>Select edges in a graph</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select edges from a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

**`conditions`** an option to use filtering conditions for the retrieval of edges.

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

**`from`** an optional vector of node IDs from which the edge is outgoing for filtering the list of edges present in the graph.

**`to`** an optional vector of node IDs to which the edge is incoming for filtering the list of edges present in the graph.

## `select_last_nodes_created()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_last_nodes_created.svg">

<h4><em>Select the last set of nodes created in a graph</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select the last nodes that were created in a graph object of class `dgr_graph`. This function should ideally be used just after creating the nodes to be selected.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

## `select_last_edges_created()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_last_edges_created.svg">

<h4><em>Select the last set of edges created in a graph</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select the last edges that were created in a graph object of class `dgr_graph`. This function should ideally be used just after creating the edges to be selected.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

## `select_nodes_by_id()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_nodes_by_id.svg">

<h4><em>Select nodes in a graph by ID values</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select nodes in a graph object of class `dgr_graph` by their node ID values. If nodes have IDs that are monotonically increasing integer values, then numeric ranges can be used for the selection.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

**`nodes`** a vector of node IDs for the selection of nodes present in the graph.

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

## `select_nodes_in_neighborhood()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_nodes_in_neighborhood.svg">

<h4><em>Select nodes based on a walk distance from a specified node</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select those nodes in the neighborhood of nodes connected a specified distance from an initial node.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

**`node`** the node from which the traversal will originate.

**`distance`** the maximum number of steps from the `node` for inclusion in the selection.

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

## `select_nodes_by_degree()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_nodes_by_degree.svg">

<h4><em>Select nodes in the graph based on their degree values</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Using a graph object of class `dgr_graph`, create a selection of nodes that have certain degree values.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

**`expressions`** one or more expressions for filtering of nodes by degree values. Use a combination of a degree type (`deg` for total degree, `indeg` for in-degree, and `outdeg` for out-degree) with a comparison operator and values for comparison (e.g., use \code{"deg >= 2"} to select nodes with a degree greater than or equal to 2).

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph nodes. This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

## `select_edges_by_edge_id()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_edges_by_edge_id.svg">

<h4><em>Select edges in a graph using edge ID values</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select edges in a graph object of class `dgr_graph` using edge ID values.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`graph`** a graph object of class `dgr_graph`.

**`edges`** a vector of edge IDs for the selection of edges present in the graph.

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph edges. This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

## `select_edges_by_node_id()`

<img src="diagrams/selection/select_edges_by_node_id.svg">

<h4><em>Select edges in a graph using node ID values</em></h4>

<h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>

Select edges in a graph object of class `dgr_graph` using node ID values. All edges associated with the provided nodes will be included in the selection.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

**`nodes`** a vector of node IDs for the selection of edges present in the graph.

**`set_op`** the set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of graph edges This can either be as a `union` (the default), as an intersection of selections with `intersect`, or, as a `difference` on the previous selection, if it exists.

## `invert_selection()`
